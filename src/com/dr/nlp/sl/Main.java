/**
 * Remote programming exercise 
 * 
 * This project should be well tested and code should be checked into GitHub along with any 
 * output produced from running your program. Write your solution in the Java programming 
 * language, using only the standard libraries. Do not use any third-Â­party libraries for natural 
 * language processing. Describe any assumptions you make in your implementation. What are 
 * the limitations of your approach? What other approaches might be possible? At the end of the 
 * assignment there should be a commit/push for each of the following features. 
 
 * 1. Write a program that identifies sentence boundaries and tokenizes the text in the file 
 * "nlp_data.txt" into words. It should correctly process all symbols, including punctuation 
 * and whitespace. Every word must fall into a sentence. Create data structures that 
 * efficiently express the data you have processed. When your program runs it should 
 * output an XML representation of your Java object model.
 * 
 * 2. Modify your program from #1 to add rudimentary recognition of proper nouns ("named 
 * entities") in the input, and print a list of recognized named entities when it runs. The list 
 * of named entities is in the file "NER.txt". Enhance your data structures and output 
 * schema to store information about which portions of the text represent named entities.
 * 
 * 3. Modify your program from #2 to use "nlp_data.zip" as its input. Use a thread pool to 
 * parallelize the processing of the text files contained in the zip. Aggregate the results 
 * and modify the output schema accordingly.
